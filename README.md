# Team 1-12 Civic Connect Project

Project site: https://civic-connect-112.herokuapp.com/

This is a web application which allows users to create, find, and send email templates to government representatives concerning any topic they like. 

Login:
- Users can log in using the 'Log In' button at the top of the page which will allow them to use their Google accounts to sign in to the website.

Profile:
- Users can then view their profile and add or edit their personal data such as their address by clicking the 'Edit Profile' button.
- On the edit profile page users can change their name and address, as well as save issues that are important to them.
- On the profile page users will be able to see a list of templates that they have created.  Each template can be selected to view its contents or to send it by email.
- 'Private' templates are only accesible to you and the administrators but 'public' templates are viewable by anyone on the browse page.
- If a user has entered their address on the edit profile page they will also be able to see a list of government representatives in your area.

Create Templates:
- Users can create an email template on the 'Create Templates' page with a name, short description, template body, and tags.
- After they have finished creating a template, they can click the 'Submit for Review' button to submit it to our administrators for approval.

Browse Templates:
- Users can visit the 'Browse Templates' page to view templates from other users that have been approved by the site administrators.
- Uses will be able to select a template from the list of templates to view.
- Once they click on one of the templates they are taken to that template's page where they can edit the message and send it to any of their representatives by selecting their radio button or send to a custom email address by typing it in box, then click 'Send to Representative' to send the email to the email address or addresses you selected.
